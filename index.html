        This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate 
      classification model from a heterogeneous classifier pool is selected at each learning 
      epoch. Our goal is to achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared to 
      using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is 
      evaluated on benchmark data sets. We further consider an application to texture 
      classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with nonadaptive active 
      learning and traditional machine learning approaches. Our results show that…We conclude 
      that…

           Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is 
      learnt by an intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine 
      system, over a sequence of learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system 
      is the querying strategy, used to sample candidate training instances from a pool and 
      evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential to improve the classification 
      model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by Committee (Seung et      
      al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty sampling (Lewis and 
      Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller, 2001). 
      Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are 
      presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the 
      class labels. After adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised 
      model is subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve an efficient, incremental 
      advancement of learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion 
      has been met, such as reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is 
      contrary to the model, causing the classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008).
